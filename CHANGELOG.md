# Changelog

All notable changes to CryptoScan are recorded here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Operational crypto was silently dropped by the noise filter.** The scanner
  decided whether a match was low-value by testing the whole source line
  against a list of about a hundred substrings, and dropped the finding on any
  hit. Three of those entries matched ordinary code:
  - `".md"`, intended for Markdown filenames, matched every `.md5(` in the
    corpus. `a.md5(b)`, `hashlib.md5(b"a")` and
    `return hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()` all reported zero findings.
  - `"cipher ="` matched `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES")`, the
    conventional way to name a `javax.crypto.Cipher`.
  - `"const "` matched `const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(...)`, which
    `prefer-const` makes the idiomatic form in JavaScript.

  The heuristic has been replaced by an evidence classifier anchored to the
  position of the match. A match that is part of a call, a member access, an
  import or an argument to a crypto factory is now always reported, whatever
  else appears on the line.

- **Suppression is now counted and recoverable.** Matches held back as prose,
  log output, comments, URLs or documentation and configuration values are
  reported as a count in the scan summary, and `--include-narrative` (also
  covered by `--verbose`) shows them. Detected key material is never held back,
  since a private key in a comment is still an exposed private key.

- **`cryptoscan:ignore` no longer blinds the following line.** A trailing
  directive suppressed both its own line and the next one. A directive now
  applies to its own line unless it says `cryptoscan:ignore-next-line`.

- **Go DES usage was undetectable.** `des.NewCipher` and
  `des.NewTripleDESCipher` are the Go standard library's only DES constructors
  and no pattern matched them.

- **Every output surface reported a different version.** One binary reported
  `1.4.0` from the `version` command, `1.0.0` in SARIF, `1.1.0` in CBOM, and no
  version at all in JSON. A CBOM naming the wrong producer is a false
  provenance record. All surfaces now read `pkg/version`, and JSON carries a
  `tool` object.

- **Finding order was nondeterministic.** Results were built by ranging over a
  map, so two scans of an unchanged tree emitted the same findings in a
  different order. This broke diffable CI output, golden-file tests and
  reproducible CBOMs.

### Added

- `--include-narrative` flag to show algorithm mentions held back as text.
- `tool` object in JSON output, carrying the scanner name and version.
- `narrativeSuppressedCount` in the scan summary.
